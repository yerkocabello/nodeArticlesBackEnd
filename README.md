First, clone https://github.com/yerkocabello/nodeArticlesFrontEnd.git and start that project (Instructions are available in a README.md on its root folder)
Execute npm install before running the app.
Install MongoDB (Community Server) from the following link: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community
Make sure to configure the PATH on your operating system so you can make use of its features on a terminal.
Upon successful installation initiate the server by executing mongod.
Finally, start the app by executing node app.js on the root folder of the project.
At first the collection won't have data, but the app will create it from the API's results, and then it will be automatically stored on the MongoDB.
